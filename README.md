Heightpredict - Developed by (Kevin Low)[http://kevinlxk.wordpress.com]
=============

This repo contains the Shiny UI and server-side R-scripts for a Child's height prediction app. This app was written for the Coursera Developing Data Products Course.

Files included:
* ui.R
* server.R

Most of the explanation and documentation is already included in the shiny app codes themselves and should be self-explanatory.
